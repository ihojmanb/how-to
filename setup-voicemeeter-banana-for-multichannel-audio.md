# Setup ASIO driver with Voicemeeter for multiple channel audio
1. set computer audio to voicemeeter Input (so everyprogram send audio to voicemeeter)
2. set ableton (or any daw) audio device to ASIO 
3. open hardware setup and select VB-Audio Voicemeeter AUX VAIO (so ableton can send audio to the aux channel)

With all that, you can now use ableton and any other audio source together (like listening to music in youtube or spotify).  
There is also a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yEp5mXNv1A&list=LL&index=4) explaining all this processs.
