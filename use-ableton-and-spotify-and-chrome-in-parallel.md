## How to use Ableton, Spotify and Chrome simultaneously
This Tutorial is for people who need to use multiple audio sources in parallel.  

This is a Windows tutorial, check for yourself is this a problem in Mac and if this is a possible solution to it (and let me know if it does work!).

You should have ASIO4ALL installed on windows.

### Why is this a problem? 
Well, if you have use your favorite DAW and tried to listen to a YouTube video while 
producing (maybe you are learning to use an audio effect, or how to mix vocals), it's probable that you were not able to do it: Chrome (or any browser) won't emit any sound.
This is because you have already routed your sound card to your DAW, having exclusiveness over other applications. Here, we are going to solve that.  

Lets begin!  

### Step-by-Step

1. Download VoiceMeeter Banana
  The first step is to download VoiceMeeter **Banana** (banana, not the other versions). This app (free by the way) will let us re route the sound coming from every app in a 
  virtual way, leting us play multiple sounds from different sources.  
  
2. Select VoiceMeeter **input** as your primary sound sorce in the bottom-right corner sound icon
  after installing it, you should be able to select this option  
  
3. Open the Voice Meeter Banana app
  You should keep it open the whole time you need to listen to multiple sources  
  
4. Open YouTube or Spotify
  an reproduce any sound with it. It should not be sounding anything, but this is our way to test that our solution will work. Keep it playing.
5. Open Ableton (or your favorite DAW)  
  press play with the metronome on. Sound should not be playing, this way we will know if our solution works when you start hearing the metronome. Keep it playing.  
6. Go to your DAW preferences
  Select ASIO4ALL as your Audio device, then hit the Hardware Setup Button There you should select VB Audio VoiceMeeter **AUX** as your source.  
7. Go back to your VoiceMeeter Banana App
  You should see an 'A1' button, select the hardware you want to route your multiple sound sources to. In my case, I want to use my speakers connected to my audio interface 
  (JBL speakers through a Presonus AudioBox)  
8. Enjoy!
