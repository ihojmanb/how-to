# how-to
how to everything, from extracting a tar file to adding a git repository in an existing directory, to initializing a Vue App.

I'm saving every command I frequently use but tend to forget. It started with a bunch of .txt files that now I'm turning into .md files, but this method is not optimal nor scalable. That's why I'm building an app to get all this done.
